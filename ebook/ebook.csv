Developing Microservices with Node.js,http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Developing-Microservices-with-Nodejs-400x493.jpg,"Microservices architecture is a style of software architecture. As the name suggests, microservicess refers to small services. For a large implementation, this means breaking the system into really small, independent services. Alternative to monolithic architecture (where the entire system is considered as a single big, interwoven segment), microservices approach is getting more and more popular with large, complex applications that have a very long lifecycle, which require changes at regular intervals. Microservices approach allows this type of changes with ease as only a part of the system undergoes changes and change control is easy. An example of such large system can be an online store―includes user interface, managing product catalog, processing orders, managing customer’s account. In a microservices architecture each of these tasks will be divided and into smaller services. Also, these services will be further broken down into independent services―for user interface, there will be separate services for input, output, search bar management, and so on. Similarly, all other tasks can be divided in very small and simple services.

MDX with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Analysis Services Cookbook,http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MDX-with-Microsoft-SQL-Server-2008-R2-Analysis-Services-Cookbook-400x493.jpg,"MDX-related books often dedicate a significant part of their content to explaining the concepts of multidimensional cubes, the MDX language and its functions, and other specifics related to working with Analysis Services. And that’s perfectly fine, there should be books like that, the tutorials that teach the concepts. However, that also means that when it comes to examples, there’s usually not enough space to provide all the details about them and their variations, otherwise the book would become huge or oftentimes lose its focus. The result of that is that making a step further from the provided calculations and queries might not be an easy task for an average reader. The other problem with tutorials is that the solution to a particular problem might be scattered throughout the book, which is where the cookbook style of books like this one come into play. Similar to data warehouses where we consolidate many tables of the relational database into a few and then organize those dimension tables in a topic-based star schema, in cookbooks we aggregate the information about a particular problem in form of one or more recipes and present that topic-based knowledge in full detail. Both the relational databases and the data warehouses have their purpose; it’s not uncommon to see them together in one place. The same is true about books and their approaches. What we also know is that there are far too few data warehouses than relational databases. Again, the same is with MDX-related cookbooks in respect to MDX tutorials, particularly those dealing with advanced topics. As a writer, I hope you recognize my intention and the value this book could bring you. As a reader, we rarely have enough time to start reading a book, not to mention f nish it. This is another advantage of the cookbook format. You can browse through the contents and look for the solution to a particular problem. As the recipes are relatively short and organized in chapters, that task won’t take much of your time. All the information will be in one place. In addition to that, you’ll see which recipes are related to that one, so that you can learn even more.",http://file.allitebooks.com/20160505/MDX with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Analysis Services Cookbook.pdf,http://www.allitebooks.com/mdx-with-microsoft-sql-server-2008-r2-analysis-services-cookbook/,Tomislav Piasevoli,1849681309,2011,480,SQL

Seam in Action,http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Seam-in-Action-361x500.jpg,"JBoss Seam is an exciting new application framework based on the Java EE platform that is used to build rich, web-based business applications. Seam is rapidly capturing the interest of Java enterprise developers because of its focus on simplicity, ease of use, transparent integration, and scalability. Seam in Action offers a practical and in-depth look at JBoss Seam. The book puts Seam head-to-head with the complexities in the Java EE architecture. The author presents an unbiased view of Seam from outside the walls of RedHat/JBoss, focusing on such topics as Spring integration and deployment to alternative application servers to steer clear of vendor lock-in. By the end of the book, you should expect to not only gain a deep understanding of Seam, but also come away with the confidence to teach the material to others. To start off, you will see a working Java EE-compliant application come together by the end of the second chapter. As you progress through the book, you will discover how Seam eliminates unnecessary layers and configurations, solves the most common JSF pain points, and establishes the missing link between JSF, EJB 3 and JavaBean components. The author also shows you how Seam opens doors for you to incorporate technologies you previously have not had time to learn, such as business processes and stateful page flows (jBPM), Ajax remoting, PDF generation, asynchronous tasks, and more. All too often, developers spend a majority of their time integrating disparate technologies, manually tracking state, struggling to understand JSF, wrestling with Hibernate exceptions, and constantly redeploying applications, rather than on the logic pertaining to the business at hand.

The industry is moving from object-oriented languages to functional languages, and you need to commit to radical improvement. New programming languages arm you with the tools and idioms you need to refine your craft. While other language primers take you through basic installation and “Hello, World,” we aim higher. Each language in Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks will take you on a step-by-step journey through the most important paradigms of our time. You’ll learn seven exciting languages: Lua, Factor, Elixir, Elm, Julia, MiniKanren, and Idris. Learn from the award-winning programming series that inspired the Elixir language. Hear how other programmers across broadly different communities solve problems important enough to compel language development. Expand your perspective, and learn to solve multicore and distribution problems. In each language, you’ll solve a non-trivial problem, using the techniques that make that language special. Write a fully functional game in Elm, without a single callback, that compiles to JavaScript so you can deploy it in any browser. Write a logic program in Clojure using a programming model, MiniKanren, that is as powerful as Prolog but much better at interacting with the outside world.

Fire in the Valley,http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Fire-in-the-Valley-400x493.jpg,"In the 1970s, while their contemporaries were protesting the computer as a tool of dehumanization and oppression, a motley collection of college dropouts, hippies, and electronics fanatics were engaged in something much more subversive. Obsessed with the idea of getting computer power into their own hands, they launched from their garages a hobbyist movement that grew into an industry, and ultimately a social and technological revolution. What they did was invent the personal computer: not just a new device, but a watershed in the relationship between man and machine. This is their story. Fire in the Valley is the definitive history of the personal computer, drawn from interviews with the people who made it happen, written by two veteran computer writers who were there from the start. Working at InfoWorld in the early 1980s, Swaine and Freiberger daily rubbed elbows with people like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates when they were creating the personal computer revolution. A rich story of colorful individuals, Fire in the Valley profiles these unlikely revolutionaries and entrepreneurs, such as Ed Roberts of MITS, Lee Felsenstein at Processor Technology, and Jack Tramiel of Commodore, as well as Jobs and Gates in all the innocence of their formative years. This completely revised and expanded third edition brings the story to its completion, chronicling the end of the personal computer revolution and the beginning of the post-PC era. It covers the departure from the stage of major players with the deaths of Steve Jobs and Douglas Engelbart and the retirements of Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer; the shift away from the PC to the cloud and portable devices; and what the end of the PC era means for issues such as personal freedom and power, and open source vs. proprietary software.",http://file.allitebooks.com/20160405/Fire in the Valley.pdf,http://www.allitebooks.com/fire-in-the-valley/,"Michael Swaine , Paul Freiberger",1937785769,2014,414,Macintosh Hardware & DIY

Probabilistic programming is a programming paradigm in which code models are used to draw probabilistic inferences from data. By applying specialized algorithms, programs assign degrees of probability to conclusions and make it possible to forecast future events like sales trends, computer system failures, experimental outcomes, and other critical concerns. Practical Probabilistic Programming explains how to use the PP paradigm to model application domains and express those probabilistic models in code. It shows how to use the Figaro language to build a spam filter and apply Bayesian and Markov networks to diagnose computer system data problems and recover digital images. Then it dives into the world of probabilistic inference, where algorithms help turn the extended prediction of social media usage into a science. The book covers functional-style programming for text analysis and using object-oriented models to predict social phenomena like the spread of tweets, and using open universe models to model real-life social media usage.

Agile Web Development with Rails 3.2,http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/1459/31570036eb61437.jpeg,"Rails just keeps on changing. Rails 3 and Ruby 1.9 bring hundreds of improvements, including new APIs and substantial performance enhancements. The fourth edition of this award-winning classic has been reorganized and refocused so it’s more useful than ever before for developers new to Ruby and Rails. Rails 3 is a major release–the changes aren’t just incremental, but structural. So we decided to follow suit. This book isn’t just a mild reworking of the previous edition to make it run with the new Rails. Instead, it’s a complete refactoring. You’ll still find the Depot example at the front, but you’ll also find testing knitted right in. Gone are the long reference chapters–that’s what the web does best. Instead you’ll find more targeted information on all the aspects of Rails that you’ll need to be a successful Web developer. Now Updated for Rails 3.2 Rails 3.1 and Rails 3.2 introduce many user-facing changes, and this release has been updated to match all the latest changes and new best practices in Rails 3.1 and Rails 3.2. This includes full support for Ruby 1.9.2 hash syntax; incorporation of the new Sprockets 2.0 Asset Pipeline, including SCSS and CoffeeScript; jQuery now being the default; reversible migrations; JSON response support; Rack::Cache, and much more. Ruby on Rails helps you produce high-quality, beautiful-looking web applications quickly. You concentrate on creating the application, and Rails takes care of the details. Tens of thousands of developers have used this award-winning book to learn Rails. It’s a broad, far-reaching tutorial and reference that’s recommended by the Rails core team. If you’re new to Rails, you’ll get step-by-step guidance. If you’re an experienced developer, this book will give you the comprehensive, insider information you need. Rails has evolved over the years, and this book has evolved along with it. We still start with a step-by-step walkthrough of building a real application, and in-depth chapters look at the built-in Rails features. This edition now gives new Ruby and Rails users more information on the Ruby language and takes more time to explain key concepts throughout. Best practices on how to apply Rails continue to change, and this edition keeps up. Examples use cookie backed sessions, HTTP authentication, and Active Record-based forms, and the book focuses throughout on the right way to use Rails.

This book taught me all [that is] possible with simple HTML5 and CSS3 coding…What a game changer!” That’s what one web designer posted about the previous edition of Murach’s HTML5 and CSS3. Now, this 3rd Edition adds professional coverage of Responsive Web Design a must for all web developers while it updates and improves all the content in the previous edition. So whether you’re a web designer, a JavaScript programmer, a server-side programmer, or a rookie, this book delivers the HTML/CSS coding skills you need today. It begins with an 8-chapter hands-on course that teaches you HTML5 and CSS3 from scratch, showing you how you can’t use one without the other nowadays. This quick-start course ends with a chapter that teaches you how to use Responsive Web Design (RWD) so your pages will look good and work right on any screen, from phone to tablet to desktop and beyond. In fact, you ll learn more about RWD in this one chapter than you can in many full books on the subject! After that, you can go on to any other chapter in the book to learn new skills whenever you need them. For example, you can learn how to enhance a site with audio and video clips, forms with HTML5 data validation, or CSS3 transitions and animations. You can see how to use JavaScript and jQuery to add features like accordions, tabs, and slide shows to a page, or to create a mobile site when a responsive site is impractical. You can learn the principles of web design, as well as how to deploy your finished sites. And no matter what, you can use the book as a time-saving reference whenever you have a question about HTML and CSS.","http://file.allitebooks.com/20160401/Murachs HTML5 and CSS3, 3rd Edition.pdf",http://www.allitebooks.com/murachs-html5-and-css3-3rd-edition/,"Anne Boehm , Zak Ruvalcaba",1890774839,2015,688,"HTML, HTML5 & CSS"
"Murach’s jQuery, 2nd Edition",http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Murachs-jQuery-2nd-Edition.jpg,"Today, jQuery is used in over 60% of the million most-visited websites, and that makes it one of the technologies that every web developer should master. The problem is that jQuery is difficult to learn, especially for those with limited programming experience. But now, this new edition of our jQuery book makes it easier than ever to learn how to use jQuery to create the dynamic user interfaces, fast response times, and special effects that today’s users expect. In brief, sections 2 and 3 of this book present the essential jQuery and jQuery UI (User Interface) skills for developing professional jQuery applications. With those skills, you ll be able to add all of the popular jQuery features to your web pages: image swaps, image rollovers, slide shows, accordions, tabs, carousels, and much more. Then, section 4 shows you how to use Ajax and JSON to get data from a web server and add it to a web page without reloading the page. It also shows how to use Ajax and JSON with the APIs for websites like Flickr and Google Maps and with HTML5 APIs like Geolocation, Web Storage, and Web Workers. What about section 1? It provides a four-chapter crash course in the JavaScript skills that you need to use jQuery. That means you don’t need to know JavaScript before you start using this book, and that makes this the right book for programmers who aren’t familiar with JavaScript, as well as for programming novices. This section also becomes the ideal reference for the JavaScript that’s used for the jQuery applications in this book…or for any jQuery application. The last section of this book shows you how to use jQuery Mobile to develop mobile websites. This requires little or no programming, and it’s a great alternative when it’s impractical to rebuild an established website with Responsive Web Design.","http://file.allitebooks.com/20160401/Murachs jQuery, 2nd Edition.pdf",http://www.allitebooks.com/murachs-jquery-2nd-edition/,"Anne Boehm , Zak Ruvalcaba",189077491X,2015,596,jQuery

Ruby Performance Optimization,http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/1458/9356f1e49164847.jpg,"You don’t have to accept slow Ruby or Rails performance. In this comprehensive guide to Ruby optimization, you’ll learn how to write faster Ruby code–but that’s just the beginning. See exactly what makes Ruby and Rails code slow, and how to fix it. Alex Dymo will guide you through perils of memory and CPU optimization, profiling, measuring, performance testing, garbage collection, and tuning. You’ll find that all those “hard” things aren’t so difficult after all, and your code will run orders of magnitude faster. This is the first book ever that consolidates all the Ruby performance optimization advice in one place. It’s your comprehensive guide to memory optimization, CPU optimization, garbage collector tuning, profiling, measurements, performance testing, and more. You’ll go from performance rookie to expert. First, you’ll learn the best practices for writing Ruby code that’s easy not only on the CPU, but also on memory, and that doesn’t trigger the dreaded garbage collector. You’ll find out that garbage collection accounts for 80% of slowdowns, and often takes more than 50% of your program’s execution time. And you’ll discover the bottlenecks in Rails code and learn how selective attribute loading and preloading can mitigate the performance costs of ActiveRecord. As you advance to Ruby performance expert, you’ll learn how profile your code, how to make sense out of profiler reports, and how to make optimization decisions based on them. You’ll make sure slow code doesn’t creep back into your Ruby application by writing performance tests, and you’ll learn the right way to benchmark Ruby.

The Nature of Software Development,http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/1458/9356f1e488338ff.jpg,"You need to get value from your software project. You need it “free, now, and perfect.” We can’t get you there, but we can help you get to “cheaper, sooner, and better.” This book leads you from the desire for value down to the specific activities that help good Agile projects deliver better software sooner, and at a lower cost. Using simple sketches and a few words, the author invites you to follow his path of learning and understanding from a half century of software development and from his engagement with Agile methods from their very beginning. The book describes software development, starting from our natural desire to get something of value. Each topic is described with a picture and a few paragraphs. You’re invited to think about each topic; to take it in. You’ll think about how each step into the process leads to the next. You’ll begin to see why Agile methods ask for what they do, and you’ll learn why a shallow implementation of Agile can lead to only limited improvement. This is not a detailed map, nor a step-by-step set of instructions for building the perfect project. There is no map or instructions that will do that for you. You need to build your own project, making it a bit more perfect every day. To do that effectively, you need to build up an understanding of the whole process. This book points out the milestones on your journey of understanding the nature of software development done well.

First, the architecture and applications are provided. Then, the authors review the existing works on charging and discharging strategy design for EVs. Critical challenges and research problems are identified. Promising solutions are proposed to accommodate the issues of high EV mobility, vehicle range anxiety, and power systems overload. The authors investigate innovating charging and discharging potentials for mobile EVS based on real-time information collections (via VANETS and/or cellular networks) and offer the power system adjustable load management methods. Several innovative charging/discharging strategy designs to address the challenging issues in smart grid, i.e., overload avoidance and range anxiety for individual EVs, are presented. This book presents an alternative and promising way to release the pressure of the power grid caused by peak-time EV charging demand. Mobile Electric Vehicles: Online Charging and Discharging provides valuable insights on charging/ discharging strategy design for mobile EVs and the power system management in a smart grid.

Due to this, along with the holistic nature of vSphere, administrators are forced to have the know-how on what to do when problems occur. This practical, easy-to-understand guide will give the vSphere administrator the knowledge and skill set they need in order to identify, troubleshoot, and solve issues that relate to storage visibility, storage performance, and storage capacity in a vSphere environment. This book will first give you the fundamental background knowledge of storage and virtualization. From there, you will explore the tools and techniques that you can use to troubleshoot common storage issues in today’s data centers. You will learn the steps to take when storage seems slow, or there is limited availability of storage. The book will go over the most common storage transport such as Fibre Channel, iSCSI, and NFS, and explain what to do when you can’t see your storage, where to look when your storage is experiencing performance issues, and how to react when you reach capacity. You will also learn about the tools that ESXi contains to help you with this, and how to identify key issues within the many vSphere logfiles.

Resource Optimization and Security for Cloud Services,http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Resource-Optimization-and-Security-for-Cloud-Services.jpg,"This book includes a study of trustworthiness, percentile response time, service availability, and authentication in the networks between users and cloud service providers, and at service stations or sites that may be owned by different service providers. The first part of the book contains an analysis of percentile response time, which is one of the most important SLA (service level agreements) metrics. Effective and accurate numerical solutions for the calculation of the percentile response time in single-class and multi-class queueing networks are obtained. Then, the numerical solution is incorporated in a resource allocation problem. Specifically, the authors present an approach for the resource optimization that minimizes the total cost of computer resources required while preserving a given percentile of the response time. In the second part, the approach is extended to consider trustworthiness, service availability, and the percentile of response time in Web services. These QoS metrics are clearly defined and their quantitative analysis provided. The authors then take into account these QoS metrics in a trust-based resource allocation problem in which a set of cloud computing resources is used by a service provider to host a typical Web services application for single-class customer services and multipleclass customer services respectively. Finally, in the third part of the book a thorough performance evaluation of two notable public key cryptography-based authentication techniques; Public-Key Cross Realm Authentication in Kerberos (PKCROSS) and Public Key Utilizing Tickets for Application Servers (PKTAPP, a.k.a. KX.509/KCA); is given, in terms of computational and communication times. The authors then demonstrate their performance difference using queuing networks. PKTAPP has been proposed to address the scalability issue of PKCROSS. However, their in-depth analysis of these two techniques shows that PKTAPP does not perform better than PKCROSS in a large-scale system. Thus, they propose a new public key cryptography-based group authentication technique. The performance analysis demonstrates that the new technique can scale better than PKCORSS and PKTAPP.",http://file.allitebooks.com/20160305/Resource Optimization and Security for Cloud Services.pdf,http://www.allitebooks.com/resource-optimization-and-security-for-cloud-services/,Kaiqi Xiong,1848215991,2014,192,"Networks, Protocols & APIs"

The features available in VMware’s vSphere 5.x suite of products simplify the management of resources, increase the availability of applications, and guarantee the performance of workloads deployed in the virtualized datacenters. “VMware vSphere 5.x Design Cookbook” covers the design process from creating the conceptual design, to determining the resource requirements for the logical design, and then on to creating the physical design. “VMware vSphere 5.x Datacenter Design Cookbook” begins with the process of identifying the design factors and applying them to the logical and physical design process in order to create a successful vSphere 5.x design. The key to a successful VMware vSphere 5.x design is the design’s ability to satisfy the design factors. This Cookbook walks you through the process of identifying the design factors which include the requirements the design must satisfy and the assumptions the architect makes to form the conceptual design. From the conceptual design, the logical design is created. The logical design process includes determining the architecture of and the resources required for the management, storage, network, and compute resources. This Cookbook includes recipes for calculating the resources required and determining the architecture and features to use while applying VMware recommended practices. The physical design takes the logical design requirements and maps them to the physical infrastructure required to support the resources. “VMware vSphere 5.x Datacenter Design Cookbook” offers recipes to determine the physical resources and configuration required to support the logical design while satisfying the design factors. Finally, the book provides recipes for creating design documentation.

On top of that we live in a very mobile-centric world with the rise of Android smart phones and tablet devices and the surge in demand for the Android platform. Along with the demand for more data, there is a demand for efficient, “snappy” applications, and so developers need to have a strong understanding of when different data storage methods are appropriate and when they are not. Mastering how to use these two fields to successfully create a powerful application will help you boost your knowledge and skills in this area. “Android Database Programming” is designed to help developers create and design data-centric mobile applications on Google’s Android platform. As the world goes increasingly mobile and as consumers’ demand for data-centric applications rises, knowing how to combine the two effectively will become an increasingly important asset to have as a developer. The book starts by looking at the various local data storage methods on Android, and finishes off by examining external databases and ways you can utilize them from within an Android application. This book starts by looking at local data storage methods, focusing on writing SQLite databases for your application and also looking at ways to bind these databases to the user interface.

In addition, this book will help you become a much sought-after Spark expert. Spark is one of the hottest Big Data technologies. The amount of data generated today by devices, applications and users is exploding. Therefore, there is a critical need for tools that can analyze large-scale data and unlock value from it. Spark is a powerful technology that meets that need. You can, for example, use Spark to perform low latency computations through the use of efficient caching and iterative algorithms; leverage the features of its shell for easy and interactive Data analysis; employ its fast batch processing and low latency features to process your real time data streams and so on. As a result, adoption of Spark is rapidly growing and is replacing Hadoop MapReduce as the technology of choice for big data analytics. This book provides an introduction to Spark and related big-data technologies. It covers Spark core and its add-on libraries, including Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, GraphX, and MLlib. Big Data Analytics with Spark is therefore written for busy professionals who prefer learning a new technology from a consolidated source instead of spending countless hours on the Internet trying to pick bits and pieces from different sources. The book also provides a chapter on Scala, the hottest functional programming language, and the program that underlies Spark. You’ll learn the basics of functional programming in Scala, so that you can write Spark applications in it. What’s more, Big Data Analytics with Spark provides an introduction to other big data technologies that are commonly used along with Spark, like Hive, Avro, Kafka and so on. So the book is self-sufficient; all the technologies that you need to know to use Spark are covered. The only thing that you are expected to know is programming in any language. There is a critical shortage of people with big data expertise, so companies are willing to pay top dollar for people with skills in areas like Spark and Scala. So reading this book and absorbing its principles will provide a boost―possibly a big boost―to your career.",http://file.allitebooks.com/20160217/Big Data Analytics with Spark.pdf,http://www.allitebooks.com/big-data-analytics-with-spark/,Mohammed Guller,1484209656,209656,277,Big Data

Representing and Reasoning with Qualitative Preferences,http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/1453/5256a8087d1e521.jpeg,"This book provides a tutorial introduction to modern techniques for representing and reasoning about qualitative preferences with respect to a set of alternatives. The syntax and semantics of several languages for representing preference languages, including CP-nets, TCP-nets, CI-nets, and CP-theories, are reviewed. Some key problems in reasoning about preferences are introduced, including determining whether one alternative is preferred to another, or whether they are equivalent, with respect to a given set of preferences. These tasks can be reduced to model checking in temporal logic. Specifically, an induced preference graph that represents a given set of preferences can be efficiently encoded using a Kripke Structure for Computational Tree Logic (CTL). One can translate preference queries with respect to a set of preferences into an equivalent set of formulae in CTL, such that the CTL formula is satisfied whenever the preference query holds. This allows us to use a model checker to reason about preferences, i.e., answer preference queries, and to obtain a justification as to why a preference query is satisfied (or not) with respect to a set of preferences. This book defines the notions of the equivalence of two sets of preferences, including what it means for one set of preferences to subsume another, and shows how to answer preferential equivalence and subsumption queries using model checking. Furthermore, this book demontrates how to generate alternatives ordered by preference, along with providing ways to deal with inconsistent preference specifications. A description of CRISNER-an open source software implementation of the model checking approach to qualitative preference reasoning in CP-nets, TCP-nets, and CP-theories is included, as well as examples illustrating its use.",http://file.allitebooks.com/20160126/Representing and Reasoning with Qualitative Preferences.pdf,http://www.allitebooks.com/representing-and-reasoning-with-qualitative-preferences/,"Ganesh Ram Santhanam , Samik Basu , Vasant Honavar",1627058397,2016,156,Computer Science

Datalog and Logic Databases,http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/1453/5256a80873cb9f8.jpeg,"The use of logic in databases started in the late 1960s. In the early 1970s Codd formalized databases in terms of the relational calculus and the relational algebra. A major influence on the use of logic in databases was the development of the field of logic programming. Logic provides a convenient formalism for studying classical database problems and has the important property of being declarative, that is, it allows one to express what she wants rather than how to get it. For a long time, relational calculus and algebra were considered the relational database languages. However, there are simple operations, such as computing the transitive closure of a graph, which cannot be expressed with these languages. Datalog is a declarative query language for relational databases based on the logic programming paradigm. One of the peculiarities that distinguishes Datalog from query languages like relational algebra and calculus is recursion, which gives Datalog the capability to express queries like computing a graph transitive closure. Recent years have witnessed a revival of interest in Datalog in a variety of emerging application domains such as data integration, information extraction, networking, program analysis, security, cloud computing, ontology reasoning, and many others. The aim of this book is to present the basics of Datalog, some of its extensions, and recent applications to different domains.",http://file.allitebooks.com/20160126/Datalog and Logic Databases.pdf,http://www.allitebooks.com/datalog-and-logic-databases/,"Cristian Molinaro , Sergio Greco",1627051139,2016,170,Computer Science

Scalable Big Data Architecture,http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/1452/745692ff295bdfc.jpeg,"This book highlights the different types of data architecture and illustrates the many possibilities hidden behind the term “Big Data”, from the usage of No-SQL databases to the deployment of stream analytics architecture, machine learning, and governance. Scalable Big Data Architecture covers real-world, concrete industry use cases that leverage complex distributed applications , which involve web applications, RESTful API, and high throughput of large amount of data stored in highly scalable No-SQL data stores such as Couchbase and Elasticsearch. This book demonstrates how data processing can be done at scale from the usage of NoSQL datastores to the combination of Big Data distribution. When the data processing is too complex and involves different processing topology like long running jobs, stream processing, multiple data sources correlation, and machine learning, it’s often necessary to delegate the load to Hadoop or Spark and use the No-SQL to serve processed data in real time. This book shows you how to choose a relevant combination of big data technologies available within the Hadoop ecosystem. It focuses on processing long jobs, architecture, stream data patterns, log analysis, and real time analytics. Every pattern is illustrated with practical examples, which use the different open sourceprojects such as Logstash, Spark, Kafka, and so on. Traditional data infrastructures are built for digesting and rendering data synthesis and analytics from large amount of data. This book helps you to understand why you should consider using machine learning algorithms early on in the project, before being overwhelmed by constraints imposed by dealing with the high throughput of Big data. Scalable Big Data Architecture is for developers, data architects, and data scientists looking for a better understanding of how to choose the most relevant pattern for a Big Data project and which tools to integrate into that pattern.",http://file.allitebooks.com/20160110/Scalable Big Data Architecture.pdf,http://www.allitebooks.com/scalable-big-data-architecture/,Bahaaldine Azarmi,1484213270,2015,141,Data Mining

Virtual desktops mean that rather than setting up hundreds or thousands of individual computers in an enterprise, companies can instead opt to create servers with large amounts of memory, disk, and processing resources, and use virtualization to offer these resources to end users. The result of this is that users are provided with an experience that appears to be identical to having an individual desktop PC. Each user has some disk space, processor time, and memory allocated to them, as though it is present on their own physical machine, when in reality, the resources are physically present on a centralized server. This book starts by answering the basic questions you need to ask when considering XenDesktop, followed by methods of how you can properly size your server infrastructure for XenDesktop. You’ll discover how to optimize the virtual machines used in XenDesktop, how to optimize your network for XenDesktop, and how to optimize the hypervisor and the cloud. You’ll also learn how to monitor XenDesktop to maximize performance. By the end of the book, you will be able to plan, design, build, and deploy high performance XenDesktop Virtualization systems in enterprises.

Manage information like a pro, to achieve much better financial results for the enterprise, more efficient processes, and multiple advantages over competitors. As you’ll discover in Enterprise Information Management in Practice, EIM deals with both structured data (e.g. sales data and customer data) as well as unstructured data (like customer satisfaction forms, emails, documents, social network sentiments, and so forth). With the deluge of information that enterprises face given their global operations and complex business models, as well as the advent of big data technology, it is not surprising that making sense of the large piles of data is of paramount importance. Enterprises must therefore put much greater emphasis on managing and monetizing both structured and unstructured data. As Saumya Chaki―an information management expert and consultant with IBM―explains in Enterprise Information Management in Practice, it is now more important than ever before to have an enterprise information strategy that covers the entire life cycle of information and its consumption while providing security controls. With Fortune 100 consultant Saumya Chaki as your guide, Enterprise Information Management in Practice covers each of these and the other pillars of EIM in depth, which provide readers with a comprehensive view of the building blocks for EIM. Enterprises today deal with complex business environments where information demands take place in real time, are complex, and often serve as the differentiator among competitors. The effective management of information is thus crucial in managing enterprises.

In particular, it reveals the very different timescales over which design and innovation operate, and the way in which design ideas evolve across different research groups, companies and application areas. The capture of photographs with sound is a simple idea, proposed 10 years ago, that has still not become widespread. In this new edition of the seminal 2004 book on Audio photography, the author asks “Why?” A journey through the book’s citations and related commercial products shows considerable progress in understanding the role of sound in photography, and myriad design experiments to support audio visual storytelling as a new media form. The book is a story in itself about the “long nose of innovation”, and a lesson about the need for patience and persistence in the computer industry. To reinforce this point five of the 2004 chapters are re-published in their original form. Theses describe invariant properties of ambient musical, talking and conversational photographs, and the possibility of playback from paper as well as screen. Fast Design, Slow Innovation will be of interest to researchers and designers of new media systems and experiences, and to innovation scholars or managers looking for a ten year case study of innovation in action.","http://file.allitebooks.com/20151226/Fast Design, Slow Innovation.pdf",http://www.allitebooks.com/fast-design-slow-innovation/,David M.

Professional iPhone Programming with MonoTouch and .NET/C#,http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/1450/175679b79c7ef8c.jpeg,"What .NET C# developers need to enter the hot field of iPhone apps iPhone applications offer a hot opportunity for developers. Until the open source MonoTouch project, this field was limited to those familiar with Apple’s programming languages. Now .NET and C# developers can join the party. Professional iPhone Programming with MonoTouch and .NET/C# is the first book to cover MonoTouch, preparing developers to take advantage of this lucrative opportunity. This book is for .NET developers that are interested in creating native iPhone applications written in .NET/C#. These developers want to use their existing knowledge. While .NET developers are always interested in learning, they also recognize that learning Objective-C and the specifics of the iPhone can be overwhelming. Those developers interested in MonoTouch will recognize that the cost of MonoTouch is easily made up by the ability to quickly target the iPhone using a language that they are already familiar with. This book is designed for .NET developers that want to target the iPhone. It is designed to help you get up to speed with the iPhone, not to really teach you about the .N ET Framework or C# language, which we assume you already know. This book is designed with introductory material in Chapters 1 thru 4. You should read Chapters 1 thru 4 sequentially. These chapters introduce the MonoTouch product, the basics of developing with MonoTouch and MonoDevelop, and finally, the basics of presenting data to a user with screen and data controls and how to develop a user interface for the iPhone. Once you are comfortable with these concepts, you can typically move from one chapter to another and not necessarily have to read the chapters sequentially. Chapter 1 “Introduction to iPhone Development with MonoTouch for C# Developers” This chapter looks at how the largest segment of developers can target the smartphone with the highest mindshare, and that the smartphone is growing faster in marketshare than any other device. Chapter 2 “Introduction to MonoTouch” gives you a firm foundation in MonoTouch, MonoDevelop, Interface Builder, debugging, and deploying. Chapter 3 “Planning Your App’s UI: Exploring the Screen Controls” teaches you about creating your application’s UI and specifically how the UI on the iPhone can differ from UIs that you might have created before. You also explore the Input & Value objects from the Interface Builder Objects Library. Chapter4 “Data Controls” shows the Interface Builder Objects Library Cocoa Touch classes for Controllers, Data Views, and Windows, Views, & Bars. Chapter 5 “Working with Data on the iPhone” looks at the SQLite database engine as well as strategies to store data off the device on a central server through SOAP and REST (using XML and JSON) without tying up the user interface. Chapter 6 “Displaying Data Using Tables” looks at displaying information in a table, using tables for navigation, taking advantage of UITableView’s built-in editing features, and adding a search bar to a table. Chapter 7 “Mapping” covers CoreLocation and MapKit, using Location Services, and adding maps and geocoding to your application. Chapter 8 “Application Settings” focuses on application settings, and looks at two aspects of settings for your MonoTouch app: the Info.plist and your settings bundle. It covers what settings you might want to set in your Info.plist and why, and then looks at what code it takes to read and use the settings that you save in the settings bundle. And it also takes you through the building of the settings that you might have in a social media-type application. Going through each step, you will examine the Root.plist inside the Property List Editor and see the settings dialog that will result from it. Chapter 9 “Programming with Device Hardware” covers accelerometer device orientation, and proximity detection support, networking, and developing with battery life in mind. Chapter 10 “Programming with Multimedia” discussing integrating images and the image picker, watching and recording videos, playing and recording audio, and using animation Chapter 11 “Talking to Other Applications” discusses the ways you can use MonoTouch to talk to other applications on the iPhone, both Apple-built applications and those downloaded from the App Store. It also provides helpful ways of accessing the iPhone’s Address Book and the iPod music library. Chapter 12 “Localizing for an International Audience” first defines internationalization and localization, then shows displaying translated text and images, formatting dates, times, and numbers, then extracting text for translation. Chapter 13 “Programming the iPad ” the capabilities of the iPad are, what new APIs and controls have been introduced that you can use in iPad-specific applications, and how to build applications that can work on both iPad and iPhone devices. Chapter 14 “Just Enough Objective-C” provides you with a reference and introduction to Objective-C that will help you acquire an ability to comprehend Objective-C which is something that will come in very handy. Chapter 15 “The App Store: Submitting and Marketing Your App” discusses all things App Store. First, it talks about the process that you need to go through before you are ready to submit – this includes final testing with Ad-Hoc builds and a presubmission checklist. Next it addresses actually submitting to the App Store, and then finally what to do with your app after it’s in the App Store. This chapter also touches on alternative monetization strategies such as ads or in app purchases.",http://file.allitebooks.com/20151222/Professional iPhone Programming with MonoTouch and .NETC-.pdf,http://www.allitebooks.com/professional-iphone-programming-with-monotouch-and-netc/,"Craig Dunn and Chris Hardy , Rory Blyth , Wallace B.

Practical Graph Analytics with Apache Giraph,http://www.allitebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/1450/175679b7887ef9b.jpeg,"Practical Graph Analytics with Apache Giraph helps you build data mining and machine learning applications using the Apache Foundation’s Giraph framework for graph processing. This is the same framework as used by Facebook, Google, and other social media analytics operations to derive business value from vast amounts of interconnected data points. Graphs arise in a wealth of data scenarios and describe the connections that are naturally formed in both digital and real worlds. Examples of such connections abound in online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, among users who rate movies from services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, and are useful even in the context of biological networks for scientific research. Whether in the context of business or science, viewing data as connected adds value by increasing the amount of information available to be drawn from that data and put to use in generating new revenue or scientific opportunities. Apache Giraph offers a simple yet flexible programming model targeted to graph algorithms and designed to scale easily to accommodate massive amounts of data. Originally developed at Yahoo!, Giraph is now a top top-level project at the Apache Foundation, and it enlists contributors from companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Practical Graph Analytics with Apache Giraph brings the power of Apache Giraph to you, showing how to harness the power of graph processing for your own data by building sophisticated graph analytics applications using the very same framework that is relied upon by some of the largest players in the industry today.",http://file.allitebooks.com/20151222/Practical Graph Analytics with Apache Giraph.pdf,http://www.allitebooks.com/practical-graph-analytics-with-apache-giraph/,"Claudio Martella , Dionysios Logothetis , Roman Shaposhnik",1484212525,2015,315,Algorithms
